# Assembler
Final Project for CMPS 361: Software Design.
End of Fall 2016 Semester

##PASS I  ::   12/08/2016
Able to parse through a text file to determine whether a line contains a label, machine language or assembly language code, operand, and/or a comment.

##PASS II :: 12/12/2016
Translates the text lines into location, and operation code and operand location. Upon success it will begin the emulation process, PassII is responsible for handling any errors in the code itself.

###Disclaimer :: Pass II
Error-checking code has not been extensively tested, therefore not all bugs have been found / are known.

##Emulator :: (in the works as of 12/12/2016)
Working on PassII branch for emulation.
